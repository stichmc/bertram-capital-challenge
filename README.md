## Assumptions
During the creation of this webapp, I assumed that whoever would pay for coffee would be selected at random. However, someone couldn't be selected at random twice in a row.

## Data Entry
No data is required to choose who is going to pay for the coffee, unless you want to join the Bertram Capital coffee club! (It will automatically enter you into the raffle for who pays)
